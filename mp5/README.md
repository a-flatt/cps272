Write a C++ program to do the following:

Inputs a line of text.
Tokenizes the line into separate words.
Inserts the words into a binary search tree (BST), T1.
Do a postorder traversal of the tree T1 and print it, then insert them into T2.
Do a preorder traversal of the tree T2 and print it, then insert them into T3.
Do an inorder traversal of the tree T3 and print it.
Print the heights and the number of leafs in each of the three binary search trees.
