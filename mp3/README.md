For this assignment you will write a program that inserts 20 random integers from 0 to 100 in order in a linked list object. The program will create another linked list, but with 15 random integers from 0 – 100 in order. The program then will merge those two ordered linked list into a single ordered list. 

The function merge should receive references to each of the list objects to be merged and a reference to a list object into which the merged elements will be placed. There should be no duplicate numbers in the final list.

Calculate the sum of the elements and the floating-point average of the elements.

Don’t use the STL linked list, you need to build your own linked list. You may use the one in the lecture’s example.

An example of the output:

If the first list has
10, 22, 34, 45, 48, 55, 56, 57, 57, 69, 70, 72, 74, 74, 80, 83, 84, 85, 88, 88

And the second list has
50, 55, 57, 79, 81, 84, 87, 88, 90, 92, 95, 95, 95, 96, 99

The result will:
10, 22, 34, 45, 48, 50, 55, 56, 57, 69, 70, 72, 74, 79, 80, 81, 83, 84, 85, 87, 88, 90, 92, 95, 96, 99

The sum of the final list’s elements is : xxxxx
The average of the final list is : xxxx.xx
