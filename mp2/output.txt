Checkout Queue Simulation by Adam Platt
---------------------------------------
Testing two intervals: 1-4 minutes and 1-3 minutes.
Abbreviations are: ST = Start Time, Ss = Service Time, FT = Finish Time.
Sim assumes that no additional customers will be accepted after 120 minutes
However, customers still in queue by 120 minutes will be served.

The results for the first interval of 1-4 minutes are:
